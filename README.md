You might need to install the extension "live server" to use the HTML file, as you play in the browser if you are using VS code.



The main distortions of the cameras are from  lines 409-606 approximately(approximate as code may change in the future)

Also, the projectile is being shot from approximately lines 858-882.

Approximately line 122 is where you design the levels.

Lastly, I omitted/ignored code for the minimap, texture/solid ceilings, and textured/solid floors. This is to create the smearing effect on the screen so these parts of code can be ignored unless you want to implement them yourself.
